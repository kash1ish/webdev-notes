## BACKEND LEARN WHAT MATTERS 

<h1> Understanding the Internet </h1>
---
- The internet is a global network of computers that are all connected to each other.

-It allows you to send and receive data, access websites, communicate, and share information across the world.

## How does internet works?
- Every device on the internet has a unique number (IP address) to identify it.
-  Information sent over the internet is broken down into small pieces called "packets" and sent through different routes to reach the destination.
-  Servers are powerful computers that store websites, files, and data. Clients are devices like your computer or phone that request information from servers.

## World Wide Web 
- The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of websites, pages, and content that you can access using the internet.

Websites: These are collections of web pages that are linked together. They contain information, images, videos, etc.

Web Browser: A program like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari that lets you access the World Wide Web.

## Domain name and URL
- Domain Name: The human-readable address of a website, like google.com or facebook.com.

URL (Uniform Resource Locator): The full address of a specific page on the internet, like https://www.google.com/search.

DNS is like a phonebook for the internet. It converts domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand.

## How Data Travels?
When you type a website's name, your device sends a request through the internet.

The request goes to a DNS server, which finds the IP address of the website.

The server hosting the website sends the requested data back to your device.

## Internet Service Provider
An ISP is a company that provides you with access to the internet (e.g., Comcast, AT&T, or Verizon).

## HTTP and HTTPS
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): A protocol used to transfer web pages. It is less secure.

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure): A secure version of HTTP. It encrypts data to protect your privacy.

## What is Cloud?
The cloud is a network of servers that store data and run applications over the internet, rather than on your local device.

Services like Google Drive, iCloud, or Dropbox store your files in the cloud.

## Internet Protocols
TCP/IP: A set of rules that helps devices communicate over the internet.

FTP: Used for transferring files between computers.

SMTP: Used for sending emails.

## Role of Routers
A router is a device that connects your local network (like your home Wi-Fi) to the internet. It directs the data traffic between devices and the outside world.

## Extras
An IP address is a unique number that identifies a device on the internet.

Itâ€™s like the address of your home, but for your device on the internet.

Wi-Fi is a wireless technology that allows devices like laptops, phones, and tablets to connect to the internet without using cables

A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules. It helps protect devices from unauthorized access.

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that creates a secure connection to the internet by encrypting data and masking your IP address.
